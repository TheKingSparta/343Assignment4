Assignment 4 is a program that can be used to track inventory and customer data for a movie rental store.

#Compiling

To compile this project, compile all .cpp files together into a single program using C++14 or later. The program has been tested primarily on Linux using g++.

#Requirements

Requires 3 files to be in the same directory as the compiled program: data4commands.txt, data4movies.txt, and data4customers.txt. The data in data4movies and data4customers is
stored, and then the data from data4commands is used to manipulate the stored data and generate output.
